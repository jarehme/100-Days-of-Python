# Today's project was to create a simple tip calculator based on user input with 3 Tip Options - only needing 1 working option to pass. 
# I went further and made all 3 options functional as well as included a method system to ask for the predetermined values if an incorrect was input.
# This continues until an acceptable tip is acquired and will then follow through with producing the bill amount, tip included per person
